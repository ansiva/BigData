This project analyzes factors influencing bird visits to feeders using R, focusing on how housing density (rural, suburban, urban) and the presence of animals (squirrels, cats, dogs) affect bird counts. The goal is to identify patterns in bird activity and provide insights for optimizing feeder placement.

Using exploratory data analysis, data from bird counts and site conditions were merged, cleaned, and analyzed. Outliers were removed, and categorical variables (e.g., housing density) were recoded for clarity. Statistical models, including Poisson and Negative Binomial regressions, were applied to evaluate relationships and interactions between variables. Visualizations were created to compare trends across years and housing densities.

Results showed that bird counts decrease in urban areas but increase with the presence of squirrels. Cats had a smaller positive effect, while dogs had a negative influence. Temporal analysis revealed a significant drop in bird counts post-2022. These findings provide actionable insights to improve feeder designs and support bird conservation.
