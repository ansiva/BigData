This code snippet performs collaborative filtering to generate movie recommendations based on user ratings. It starts by loading movie titles and corresponding user ratings from 'movies.csv' and 'ratings.csv.' After cleaning the data by removing unnecessary columns, the code merges the datasets and calculates statistics such as the mean and count of ratings for each movie.

A user-movie rating matrix is created to represent user preferences, and the code specifically focuses on the movie "Pulp Fiction (1994)." By calculating correlations between the ratings of "Pulp Fiction" and other movies, the system identifies movies with similar user preferences. To refine the recommendations, movies with fewer than 50 ratings are filtered out.

The final output provides a list of top movie recommendations for viewers who enjoyed "Pulp Fiction," sorted by correlation. In essence, the code leverages collaborative filtering to suggest movies that align with the tastes of users who liked a particular film, enhancing the personalized viewing experience.
